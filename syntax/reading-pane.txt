Use and configure the Reading Pane to preview messages

Outlook for Office 365, Outlook 2019, Outlook 2016, Outlook 2013

When you select a message in the message list, you can see the
message in the Reading Pane and access many different types of
file attachments.  You can customize how the Reading Pane works
and appears, or you can turn it off.

In addition to using the Reading Pane to help you quickly scan
your messages, you can also preview the first few lines of
messages in your message list, and you can break up long
messages by splitting the message window.


Turn on, turn off, or move the Reading Pane
===========================================
The Reading Pane is turned on by default. Do one of the
following:

o To turn off the Reading Pane   On the View tab, in the
  Layout group, select Reading Pane, and then select Off.

o To turn on or move the Reading Pane     On the View tab,
  in the Layout group, select Reading Pane, and then select
  Right or Bottom.


Selecting Off closes the Reading Pane only for the folder
youâ€™re in. To turn off the Reading Pane quickly for
multiple folders, on the View tab, select Change View > \
Apply Current View to Other Mail Folders, and then choose
folders in the Apply View dialog box.
