At GCI Network Services, OSS on marcilr1 win 7 pro virtual machine,
after a restore to external 2TB Seagate, from the internal 2TB
WD that was toasted I got a classic error in Outlook 2010:

"Outlook is using an old copy of your Outlook data file (.ost), Exit Outlook,
delete the file, and restart Outlook.  A new file will be automatically
created the next time you initiate a send/receive."

To find data file in Outlook:
1. Click File tab
2. Click Account Settings > Account Settings...
3. Click Data Files tab

The Outlook Data File (.ost) location appears in the Location column for the
Exchange account.

In my case this was:
  C:\Users\rmarcil.GCI\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\rmarcil@gci.com.ost

Deleted rmarcil@gci.com.ost, actually moved to the desktop to convince myself
it would be recreated, then restarted Outlook.  On restart the Data File (.ost)
was recreated.
