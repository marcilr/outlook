Fix ost file (rename) for Outlook Office 365 


Was having issues with Outlook Office 365 on Windows 10
at State of Alaska OIT DNR.  Outlook refused to fetch
new mail and the inbox had issues.

The solution was to add .OLD to the ost file then let
outlook rebuild it with the following procedure:

Outlook data file:
  Name:     ray.marcil@alaska.gov
  Location: C:\Users\remarcil\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\
            ray.marcil@alaska.gov -

To access AppData:

1. Open File Explorer/Windows Explorer
2. Type %AppData% into the address bar and hit enter
   Had: C:\Users\remarcil\%AppData%
        This openeed the AppData\Roaming folder
3. Navigate to the required folder (Roaming or Local)
4. Search AppData for ray.marcil yields:

ray.marcil@alaska.gov - Ray.ost
C:\Users\remarcil\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook

5. Renamed "ray.marcil@alaska.gov - Ray.ost" to:
"ray.marcil@alaska.gov - Ray.ost.OLD"

i.   Got error:
     "The action can't be completed because the file is open in Skype for Business.
ii.  Exited Skype for Business window
iii. Renamed "ray.marcil@alaska.gov - Ray.ost" to:
     "ray.marcil@alaska.gov - Ray.ost.OLD"

6. Launched Outlook Office 365
i. Prompted to login with:
   ray.marcil@alaska.gov
ii. Login worked correctly
   Retrieving mail box settings...
   ...
   Launched correctly with 16 items in inbox

Outlook fixed!

7. Launch Skype for Business - runs and opens correctly
